# Tic Tac Toe

In this project, the student builds a Tic Tac Toe game. The main goal is to put into practice the main concepts of Object Oriented Programming. Particularly, classes and access to their attributes.

## Project specifications

Build a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns.

more about the specifications  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)

## Link to assignment

the assignment can be found  [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/oop).

## Usage

To run the game you should add execute permissions to the main file. [Here](https://commandercoriander.net/blog/2013/02/16/making-a-ruby-script-executable/) you can find more information. 

    chmod 755 main.rb

After that you can start the game by running

    ./bin/main.rb

## Testing with RSpec 

To run the test cases with RSpec we have to follow this steps:

installing RSpec

    gem install rspec

Once that‚Äôs done, you can verify your version of RSpec with, for this project we had used the version 3.9 

    rspec --version

finally run for watch the results

    rspec


## Watch the result of RSpec

You can see the result of testing

      returns the board array with the symbols updated
  #get_coord
    Create a Coordinate related to the position given
      returns coordinate(0,1) when position is 2
      returns coordinate(1,2) when position is 6

      returs true if a all line is filled with the gicen symbol
      returs true if a all line is filled with the given symbol
  #check_line_draw
    check when all line are not filled with the same symbol    
      returs true if all lines are not filled with the given symbol
      returs false if some line is filled with the given symbol

## Instructions

Tic Tac Toe is a game for two players who take turns to mark spaces in a 3x3 grid board, using the symbols 'X' and 'O'.

In this game each cell of the board is represented by a position(number) from 1 to 9, as shown below:

    |  1    2    3  |
    |  4    5    6  |
    |  7    8    9  |

When starting the game, it is going to ask you for the names of the players. For example:
    
    Please enter a name for player 1:

And after the name of the first player, it is going to ask you for the symbol:
    
    Choose between 'X' or 'O':

Then it will show you the names of the two players and the symbol for each one. And you can start playing!
    
    --------------------------------------
    symbol: X    Name: ARIEL CAMUS
    symbol: O    Name: WILLOW
    --------------------------------------
    ARIEL CAMUS and WILLOW are you ready? (Y/N):

The game will ask for a position representing the current player's move on the board.
    
    Player 'ARIEL CAMUS' please choose a position (from 1 to 9): 

Unless there is a winner or the board gets full (which means it is a draw), the game will ask to the next player for choosing another position.

A winner will be found when a player gets a single line (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) with the same symbol.

For example, the following board shows an horizontal line winning move for the player X:

    |  1    2    O  |
    |  X    X    X  |
    |  7    O    9  |
